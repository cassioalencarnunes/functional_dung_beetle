In this repository we included codes and data that we used to run the Rarity Index calculation and the simulations of species loss. As we explain in the manuscript all these analyses were adapted from Leitão et al. (2016).

1. You may find the codes to run the Rarity Index calculation in the "rarity_index.pdf" file.

2. The R script "indices_functions.R" provides the codes of the functions used to calculate Functional Richness (FRic), Functional Specialization (FSpe) and Functional Originality (FOri) with different levels of species extinctions. The functions calculate functional indices in scenarios losing rarest species first, most common species first and losing species randomly at the local scale (see details of Methods below or in the manuscript). Functions were mainly designed by Leitão et al. (2016).

3. The R script "script_simulations.R" provides the codes to run simulations of species loss at regional and local scales for FRic, FSpe and FOri indices.
